# docusaurus-meilisearch-indexer

A small script to index Docusaurus content for MeiliSearch from files instead of
scrapping it. It produces content that can be sought from
https://github.com/meilisearch/docs-searchbar.js

(right now, it's only working for Tauri Docs)

See the specs here: https://github.com/meilisearch/docs-searchbar.js/issues/40
